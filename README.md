# vehicle_counter

vehicle counter is a simple project with openCv and some other features 
i made it with two diffrent algorithems 

# 1 : 
first one is using id wich is means if every car come into camera area would be counted

# 2 :
the second one is using a line for counting wich means if any car cross the line would be counted with camera
